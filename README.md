### This is a No-[Tether](https://github.com/HubSpot/tether)-Depend Select.js version which is originally forked from https://github.com/HubSpot/select . All I did is removed [Tether](https://github.com/HubSpot/tether) Dependency.

Select.js is a Javascript and CSS library for creating styleable select elements.  It aims to reproduce the behavior of native controls as much as is possible, while allowing for complete styling with CSS.
